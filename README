INTRODUCTION

www.jimmykiselak.com/simpleddns/about/

simpleddns is a Ruby ddns client script specifically for dyndns.org.

CONFIGURATION

www.jimmykiselak.com/simpleddns/src/

simpleddns requires the use of a YAML configuration file, included as conf.yml

It also requires a file to temporarily store the current IP address and optionally can write to a log file.

The IP file should contain only the IP address in dotted format (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) and the script should have read and write access to this file

The log file will record whether or not the address has changed since the last run and if it has changed it will record whether or not the update was successful. The script should have write access to the log file.

USE

www.jimmykiselak.com/simpleddns/src/

It is suggested that the script be run by a cron job. To run the script, go to the directory with the script and type `simpleddns`. If your YAML configuration file is not in the same directory or is not called conf.yml, then run it as `simpleddns -c /path/to/config_file.yml`
